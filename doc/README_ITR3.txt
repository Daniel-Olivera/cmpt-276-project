User Stories Interpretation:
1) First run of the app is done with internet connection, otherwise how did the user get the app
    in the first place?
2) App starts via UpdateActivity that checks for updates in the Surrey servers, this behaviour was
    permitted in Piazza:https://piazza.com/class/k47bhfajff66cx?cid=230
3) For the user story section:
   "When new data is downloaded from the City of Surrey's server,
   I want to be told if there are any new inspections for my favourite restaurants."
   We made the displayed restaurants clickable to access the restaurant details page.
4) Search on hazard levels allows exactly one choice,
   as per https://piazza.com/class/k47bhfajff66cx?cid=255
5) Translation also includes hazard levels (low, mid, high), critical/non-critical violation text,
   and inspection type text, despite these information came directly from the data.
